# Extracting specific informations from web pages

> July 24, 2014 - by Séverine

OpenSearchServer comes with a **complete index template for Web Crawling jobs**. This default configuration suits most users, since it extracts all commonly needed information from webpages: title, meta keywords, content, and so on.

However, some users **want more informations when crawling web pages.** They might want the Web Crawler to **extract specific information** such as “Categories”, “Date of post” or “Author of the post”. Or they might want to crawl an e-commerce website to specifically extract information such as “price”, “currency”, “description”, “reference”, etc., and store those informations in specific fields.

The good news is, OpenSearchServer and its Web Crawler were **built with these needs in mind**!
