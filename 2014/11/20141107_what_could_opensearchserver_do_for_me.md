# What could OpenSearchServer do for me?

> November 7, 2014 - by Alexandre

With OpenSearchServer, you will easily be able to:

* **Set up a competitive intelligence system**: OSS's powerful web crawler can automatically explore as many websites as needed in order to extract structured data - such as prices or product descriptions.
* **Integrate a highly relevant "full-text" search engine in less than 5 minutes**: you just create an index using the "website" OSS template, have the web crawler explore your website, and then create a "renderer" (search page) - before displaying it on your website through an iFrame!
* **Build an elaborate search portal**: OpenSearchServer's numerous REST APIs give you the toolset to integrate its powerful features with all your applications: intranet, extranet, etc.
* **Index all your company's files** in order to offer a one-stop search engine to your employees: PDF, Microsoft Office files, emails, etc. OpenSearchServer's files crawler can read anything!
* **Configure the security policy that works best for you**: OpenSearchServer can read and register right of access information for files and webpages. Rest assured that each user will only see results that they are authorized to see!

The possibilities are endless!
