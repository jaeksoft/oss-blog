# Preventing insignificant words from being indexed

> August 25, 2014 - by Alexandre

When indexing data and running search queries, one usually wants to give a weight of zero to insignificant words such as “the”, “of”, etc.

The common solution offered by search engines is called “stop words”.

With OpenSearchServer, **managing and enabling a list of stop words is really simple**.

Here is how you can write this list in the interface:

![Stopwords](../images/stopwords.png)

And here is a demonstration of the process **applied by an analyzer** for the sentence “Bryan is in the kitchen”:

![Test of stopwords](../images/stopwords_analyzer.png)

See how the StopFilter has parsed down the sentence to its significant words ?

You are of course free to use this feature for another purpose such as **filtering out swear words**. Since OpenSearchServer allows for creating multiple lists of stop words, you can apply different lists to different fields in the schema and use them separately in your queries!
